# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Feast

## Introduction

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security mechanism that restricts access to resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization. In the context of the Feast, RBAC ensures that only authorized users or groups can access or modify specific resources, thereby maintaining data security and operational integrity.

## Functional Requirements

The RBAC implementation in Feast is designed to:

- **Assign Permissions**: Allow administrators to assign permissions for various operations and resources to users or groups based on their roles.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrate smoothly with existing business code without requiring significant modifications.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain support for non-authorized models as the default to ensure backward compatibility.

## Business Goals

The primary business goals of implementing RBAC in the Feast are:

1. **Feature Sharing**: Enable multiple teams to share the feature store while ensuring controlled access. This allows for collaborative work without compromising data security.
2. **Access Control Management**: Prevent unauthorized access to team-specific resources and spaces, governing the operations that each user or group can perform.

## Reference Architecture

Feast operates as a collection of connected services, each enforcing authorization permissions. The architecture is designed as a distributed microservices system with the following key components:

- **Service Endpoints**: These enforce authorization permissions, ensuring that only authorized requests are processed.
- **Client Integration**: Clients authenticate with feature servers by attaching authorization token to each request.
- **Service-to-Service Communication**: This is always granted.

## Permission Model

The RBAC system in Feast uses a permission model that defines the following concepts:

- **Resource**: An object within Feast that needs to be secured against unauthorized access.
- **Action**: A logical operation performed on a resource, such as Create, Describe, Update, Delete, Read, or write operations.
- **Policy**: A set of rules that enforce authorization decisions on resources. The default implementation uses role-based policies.



## Authorization Architecture

The authorization architecture in Feast is built with the following components:

- **Token Extractor**: Extracts the authorization token from the request header.
- **Token Parser**: Parses the token to retrieve user details.
- **Policy Enforcer**: Validates the secured endpoint against the retrieved user details.
- **Token Injector**: Adds the authorization token to each secured request header.
