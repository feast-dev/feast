# Installing Feast

## Overview

This installation guide will demonstrate three ways of installing Feast:

* [**Docker Compose \(Quickstart\)**](install-feast.md#docker-compose)**:** Allow quick testing on Feast via a sample Jupyter notebook pre-installed with Feast Python SDK.
* [**Minikube \(Minimal\)**](installing-feast.md#minikube)**:** This installation has no external dependencies, but does not have a historical feature store installed. It allows users to quickly get a feel for Feast.
* [**Google Kubernetes Engine \(Recommended\):**](installing-feast.md#google-kubernetes-engine) This guide installs a single cluster Feast installation on Google's GKE. It has Google Cloud specific dependencies like BigQuery, Dataflow, and Google Cloud Storage.


## Docker Compose

### Overview

A docker compose file is provided to quickly test Feast with official docker images. GCP dependency is optional.

* Define and register feature set
* Feature ingestion
* Retrieve features for online serving
* Updating the feature set

The docker compose setup uses Direct Runner for the Apache Beam jobs.

### 0. Requirements

1. [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) should be installed.
2. Port 6565, 6566 and 8888, 9094 are not in used. Otherwise, modify the port mappings in  `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` to use unoccupied ports.
3. For batch serving, you will also need a service account key that has access to GCS and BigQuery. Port 6567 will be used for the batch serving endpoint.

### 1. Step-by-step guide (Online serving)
1. Navigate to `infra/docker-compose`.
2. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`.
3. `docker-compose up -d`
4. A jupyter notebook server should be accessible via `localhost:8888`
5. Please wait a minute or two for the Feast services to be ready before running the notebook. You will know that the services are ready when port `6565` and `6566` starts listening.

### 2. Step-by-step guide (Batch serving)
1. Navigate to `infra/docker-compose`.
2. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`.
3. Copy your GCP account service key(s) to `infra/docker-compose/gcp-service-accounts`.
4. Modify the value of `FEAST_<SERVICE_NAME>_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` in your `.env` file. It should be the json file name without extension.
5. Modify the value of `infra/docker-compose/serving/bq-store.yml`. Alternatively, you can also point to a different store configuration file by modifying `FEAST_BATCH_STORE_CONFIG` in your `.env` file.
5. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.batch.yml up -d`
6. A jupyter notebook server should be accessible via `localhost:8888`
7. Please wait a minute or two for the Feast services to be ready before running the notebook. You will know that the services are ready when port `6565` and `6567` starts listening.
8. When you are done, run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.batch.yml down` to shutdown the services.

## Minikube

### Overview

This guide will install Feast into [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). Once Feast is installed you will be able to:

* Define and register features.
* Load feature data from both batch and streaming sources.
* Retrieve features for online serving.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This Minikube installation guide is for demonstration purposes only. It is not meant for production use, and does not install a historical feature store.
{% endhint %}

### 0. Requirements

The following software should be installed prior to starting:

1. [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) should be installed.
2. [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed and configured to work with Minikube.
3. [Helm](https://helm.sh/3) \(2.16.0 or greater\).

### 1. Set up Minikube

Start Minikube. Note the minimum cpu and memory below:

```bash
minikube start --cpus=3 --memory=4096 --kubernetes-version='v1.15.5'
```

Set up your Feast environmental variables

```bash
export FEAST_IP=$(minikube ip)
export FEAST_CORE_URL=${FEAST_IP}:32090
export FEAST_SERVING_URL=${FEAST_IP}:32091
```

### 2. Install Feast with Helm

Clone the [Feast repository](https://github.com/gojek/feast/) and navigate to the `charts` sub-directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gojek/feast.git && \
cd feast && export FEAST_HOME_DIR=$(pwd) && \
cd infra/charts/feast
```

Copy the `values-demo.yaml` file for your installation:

```bash
cp values-demo.yaml my-feast-values.yaml
```

Update all occurrences of the domain `feast.example.com` inside of `my-feast-values.yaml` with your Minikube IP. This is to allow external access to the services in the cluster. You can find your Minikube IP by running the following command `minikube ip`, or simply replace the text from the command line:

```bash
sed -i "s/feast.example.com/${FEAST_IP}/g" my-feast-values.yaml
```

Install Tiller:

```bash
helm init
```

Install the Feast Helm chart:

```bash
helm install --name feast -f my-feast-values.yaml .
```

Ensure that the system comes online. This will take a few minutes

```bash
watch kubectl get pods
```

```bash
NAME                                           READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

pod/feast-zookeeper-2                          1/1     Running     0          5m
```

### 3. Connect to Feast with the Python SDK

Install the Python SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install -e ${FEAST_HOME_DIR}/sdk/python
```

Configure the Feast Python SDK:

```bash
feast config set core_url ${FEAST_CORE_URL}
feast config set serving_url ${FEAST_SERVING_URL}
```

Make sure that both Feast Core and Feast Serving are connected:

```bash
feast version
```

```javascript
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "feast 0.3.2"
  },
  "core": {
    "url": "192.168.99.100:32090",
    "version": "0.3",
    "status": "connected"
  },
  "serving": {
    "url": "192.168.99.100:32091",
    "version": "0.3",
    "status": "connected"
  }
}
```

That's it! You can now start to use Feast!

## Google Kubernetes Engine

### Overview <a id="m_5245424069798496115gmail-overview-1"></a>

This guide will install Feast into a Kubernetes cluster on GCP. It assumes that all of your services will run within a single K8s cluster. Once Feast is installed you will be able to:

* Define and register features.
* Load feature data from both batch and streaming sources.
* Retrieve features for model training.
* Retrieve features for online serving.

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide requires [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) for installation.

* [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) is used for storing historical features.
* [Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/) is used for running data ingestion jobs.
* [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) is used for intermediate data storage.
{% endhint %}

### 0. Requirements <a id="m_5245424069798496115gmail-requirements"></a>

1. [Google Cloud SDK ](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install)installed, authenticated, and configured to the project you will use.
2. [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed.
3. [Helm](https://helm.sh/3) \(2.16.0 or greater\) installed on your local machine with Tiller installed in your cluster.

### 1. Set up GCP

First define the environmental variables that we will use throughout this installation. Please customize these to reflect your environment.

```bash
export FEAST_GCP_PROJECT_ID=my-gcp-project
export FEAST_GCP_REGION=us-central1
export FEAST_GCP_ZONE=us-central1-a
export FEAST_BIGQUERY_DATASET_ID=feast
export FEAST_GCS_BUCKET=${FEAST_GCP_PROJECT_ID}_feast_bucket
export FEAST_GKE_CLUSTER_NAME=feast
export FEAST_S_ACCOUNT_NAME=feast-sa
```

Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket for Feast to stage data during exports:

```bash
gsutil mb gs://${FEAST_GCS_BUCKET}
```

Create a BigQuery dataset for storing historical features:

```bash
bq mk ${FEAST_BIGQUERY_DATASET_ID}
```

Create the service account that Feast will run as:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create ${FEAST_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${FEAST_GCP_PROJECT_ID} \
  --member serviceAccount:${FEAST_S_ACCOUNT_NAME}@${FEAST_GCP_PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/editor

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account \
${FEAST_S_ACCOUNT_NAME}@${FEAST_GCP_PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Ensure that [Dataflow API is enabled](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/dataflow.googleapis.com/overview):

```bash
gcloud services enable dataflow.googleapis.com
```

### 2. Set up a Kubernetes \(GKE\) cluster

{% hint style="warning" %}
Provisioning a GKE cluster can expose your services publicly. This guide does not cover securing access to the cluster.
{% endhint %}

Create a GKE cluster:

```bash
gcloud container clusters create ${FEAST_GKE_CLUSTER_NAME} \
    --machine-type n1-standard-4
```

Create a secret in the GKE cluster based on your local key `key.json`:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic feast-gcp-service-account --from-file=key.json
```

For this guide we will use `NodePort` for exposing Feast services. In order to do so, we must find an internal IP of at least one GKE node.

```bash
export FEAST_IP=$(kubectl describe nodes | grep InternalIP | awk '{print $2}' | head -n 1)
export FEAST_CORE_URL=${FEAST_IP}:32090
export FEAST_ONLINE_SERVING_URL=${FEAST_IP}:32091
export FEAST_BATCH_SERVING_URL=${FEAST_IP}:32092
```

Confirm that you are able to access this node:

```bash
ping $FEAST_IP
```

```bash
PING 10.123.114.11 (10.203.164.22) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.123.114.11: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=54.2 ms
64 bytes from 10.123.114.11: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=51.2 ms
```

### 3. Set up Helm

Run the following command to provide Tiller with authorization to install Feast:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: tiller
  namespace: kube-system
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tiller
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tiller
    namespace: kube-system
EOF
```

Install Tiller:

```bash
helm init --service-account tiller
```

### 4. Install Feast with Helm

Clone the [Feast repository](https://github.com/gojek/feast/) and navigate to the `charts` sub-directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gojek/feast.git && cd feast && \
git checkout 0.3-dev && \
export FEAST_HOME_DIR=$(pwd) && \
cd infra/charts/feast
```

Make a copy of the Helm `values.yaml` so that it can be customized for your Feast deployment:

```bash
cp values.yaml my-feast-values.yaml
```

Update `my-feast-values.yaml` based on your GCP and GKE environment.

* Required fields are paired with comments which indicate whether they need to be replaced.
* All occurrences of `feast.example.com` should be replaced with either your domain name or the IP stored in `$FEAST_IP`.

Install the Feast Helm chart:

```bash
helm install --name feast -f my-feast-values.yaml .
```

Ensure that the system comes online. This will take a few minutes

```bash
watch kubectl get pods
```

```bash
NAME                                           READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
pod/feast-feast-core-666fd46db4-l58l6          1/1     Running     0          5m
pod/feast-feast-serving-online-84d99ddcbd      1/1     Running     0          6m
pod/feast-kafka-0                              1/1     Running     0          3m
pod/feast-kafka-1                              1/1     Running     0          4m
pod/feast-kafka-2                              1/1     Running     0          4m
pod/feast-postgresql-0                         1/1     Running     0          5m
pod/feast-redis-master-0                       1/1     Running     0          5m
pod/feast-zookeeper-0                          1/1     Running     0          5m
pod/feast-zookeeper-1                          1/1     Running     0          5m
pod/feast-zookeeper-2                          1/1     Running     0          5m
```

### 5. Connect to Feast with the Python SDK

Install the Python SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install -e ${FEAST_HOME_DIR}/sdk/python
```

Configure the Feast Python SDK:

```bash
feast config set core_url ${FEAST_CORE_URL}
feast config set serving_url ${FEAST_ONLINE_SERVING_URL}
```

Make sure that both Feast Core and Feast Serving are connected:

```bash
feast version
```

```javascript
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "feast 0.3.2"
  },
  "core": {
    "url": "192.168.99.100:32090",
    "version": "0.3",
    "status": "connected"
  },
  "serving": {
    "url": "192.168.99.100:32091",
    "version": "0.3",
    "status": "connected"
  }
}
```

That's it! You can now start to use Feast!
