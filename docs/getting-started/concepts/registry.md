# Registry

Feast uses a registry to store all applied Feast objects (e.g. Feature views, entities, etc). The registry exposes
methods to apply, list, retrieve and delete these objects, and is an abstraction with multiple implementations.

### Options for registry implementations

#### File-based registry
By default, Feast uses a file-based registry implementation, which stores the protobuf representation of the registry as
a serialized file. This registry file can be stored in a local file system, or in cloud storage (in, say, S3 or GCS, or Azure).

The quickstart guides that use `feast init` will use a registry on a local file system. To allow Feast to configure
a remote file registry, you need to create a GCS / S3 bucket that Feast can understand:
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Example S3 file registry" %}
```yaml
project: feast_demo_aws
provider: aws
registry: s3://[YOUR BUCKET YOU CREATED]/registry.pb
online_store: null
offline_store:
  type: file
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example GCS file registry" %}
```yaml
project: feast_demo_gcp
provider: gcp
registry: gs://[YOUR BUCKET YOU CREATED]/registry.pb
online_store: null
offline_store:
  type: file
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

However, there are inherent limitations with a file-based registry, since changing a single field in the registry
requires re-writing the whole registry file. With multiple concurrent writers, this presents a risk of data loss, or
bottlenecks writes to the registry since all changes have to be serialized (e.g. when running materialization for
multiple feature views or time ranges concurrently).

#### SQL Registry
Alternatively, a [SQL Registry](../../tutorials/using-scalable-registry.md) can be used for a more scalable registry.

This supports any SQLAlchemy compatible database as a backend. The exact schema can be seen in [sql.py](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/blob/master/sdk/python/feast/infra/registry/sql.py)

### Updating the registry

We recommend users store their Feast feature definitions in a version controlled repository, which then via CI/CD
automatically stays synced with the registry. Users will often also want multiple registries to correspond to
different environments (e.g. dev vs staging vs prod), with staging and production registries with locked down write
access since they can impact real user traffic. See [Running Feast in Production](../../how-to-guides/running-feast-in-production.md#1.-automatically-deploying-changes-to-your-feature-definitions) for details on how to set this up.

### Accessing the registry from clients

Users can specify the registry through a `feature_store.yaml` config file, or programmatically. We often see teams
preferring the programmatic approach because it makes notebook driven development very easy:

#### Option 1: programmatically specifying the registry

```python
repo_config = RepoConfig(
    registry=RegistryConfig(path="gs://feast-test-gcs-bucket/registry.pb"),
    project="feast_demo_gcp",
    provider="gcp",
    offline_store="file",  # Could also be the OfflineStoreConfig e.g. FileOfflineStoreConfig
    online_store="null",  # Could also be the OnlineStoreConfig e.g. RedisOnlineStoreConfig
)
store = FeatureStore(config=repo_config)
```

#### Option 2: specifying the registry in the project's `feature_store.yaml` file

```yaml
project: feast_demo_aws
provider: aws
registry: s3://feast-test-s3-bucket/registry.pb
online_store: null
offline_store:
  type: file
```

Instantiating a `FeatureStore` object can then point to this:

```python
store = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")
```
