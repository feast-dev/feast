# OpenTelemetry Integration

The OpenTelemetry integration in Feast provides comprehensive monitoring and observability capabilities for your feature serving infrastructure. This component enables you to track key metrics, traces, and logs from your Feast deployment.

## Motivation

Monitoring and observability are critical for production machine learning systems. The OpenTelemetry integration addresses these needs by:

1. **Performance Monitoring:** Track CPU and memory usage of feature servers
2. **Operational Insights:** Collect metrics to understand system behavior and performance
3. **Troubleshooting:** Enable effective debugging through distributed tracing
4. **Resource Optimization:** Monitor resource utilization to optimize deployments
5. **Production Readiness:** Provide enterprise-grade observability capabilities

## Architecture

The OpenTelemetry integration in Feast consists of several components working together:

- **OpenTelemetry Collector:** Receives, processes, and exports telemetry data
- **Prometheus Integration:** Enables metrics collection and monitoring
- **Instrumentation:** Automatic Python instrumentation for tracking metrics
- **Exporters:** Components that send telemetry data to monitoring systems

## Key Features

1. **Automated Instrumentation:** Python auto-instrumentation for comprehensive metric collection
2. **Metric Collection:** Track key performance indicators including:
   - Memory usage
   - CPU utilization
   - Request latencies
   - Feature retrieval statistics
3. **Flexible Configuration:** Customizable metric collection and export settings
4. **Kubernetes Integration:** Native support for Kubernetes deployments
5. **Prometheus Compatibility:** Integration with Prometheus for metrics visualization

## Setup and Configuration

For detailed setup instructions and configuration options, please refer to our [Helm chart documentation](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/blob/master/infra/charts/feast-feature-server/opentelemetry.md).

Key configuration steps include:

1. Deploying the Prometheus Operator
2. Setting up the OpenTelemetry Operator
3. Configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector
4. Adding instrumentation annotations
5. Configuring environment variables

## Usage

To enable OpenTelemetry monitoring in your Feast deployment:

1. Set `metrics.enabled=true` in your Helm values
2. Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint
3. Deploy with proper annotations and environment variables

Example configuration:
```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: true
  otelCollector:
    endpoint: "otel-collector.default.svc.cluster.local:4317"
```

## Monitoring

Once configured, you can monitor various metrics including:

- `feast_feature_server_memory_usage`: Memory utilization of the feature server
- `feast_feature_server_cpu_usage`: CPU usage statistics
- Additional custom metrics based on your configuration

These metrics can be visualized using Prometheus and other compatible monitoring tools.
