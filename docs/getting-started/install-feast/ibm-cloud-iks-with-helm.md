# IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service \(IKS\) \(with Helm\)

## Overview

This guide installs Feast on an existing IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster, and ensures the following services are running:

* Feast Core
* Feast Online Serving
* Postgres
* Redis
* Feast Jupyter \(Optional\)
* Prometheus \(Optional\)

## 1. Requirements

1. [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/kubernetes-service)
2. Install [Kubectl](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) that matches the major.minor versions of your IKS.
3. Install [Helm 3](https://helm.sh/)

## 2. IBM Cloud Block Storage Setup

By default, IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster uses [IBM Cloud File Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/file-storage) based on NFS as the default storage class, and non-root users do not have write permission on the volume mount path for NFS-backed storage. Some common container images in Feast, such as Redis, Postgres, and Kafka specify a non-root user to access the mount path in the images. When containers are deployed using these images, the containers fail to start due to insufficient permissions of the non-root user creating folders on the mount path.

[IBM Cloud Block Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/block-storage) allows for the creation of raw storage volumes and provides faster performance without the permission restriction of NFS-backed storage

Therefore, to deploy Feast we need to set up [IBM Cloud Block Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#install_block) as the default storage class so that you can have all the functionalities working and get the best experience from Feast.

1. [Follow the instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install the Helm version 3 client on your local machine.
2. Add the IBM Cloud Helm chart repository to the cluster where you want to use the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in.

   ```text
    helm repo add iks-charts https://icr.io/helm/iks-charts
    helm repo update
   ```

3. Install the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in. When you install the plug-in, pre-defined block storage classes are added to your cluster.

   ```text
    helm install v2.0.2 iks-charts/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin -n kube-system
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   NAME: v2.0.2
   LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Feb  5 12:29:50 2021
   NAMESPACE: kube-system
   STATUS: deployed
   REVISION: 1
   NOTES:
   Thank you for installing: ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin.   Your release is named: v2.0.2
    ...
   ```

4. Verify that all block storage plugin pods are in a "Running" state.

   ```text
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep ibmcloud-block-storage
   ```

5. Verify that the storage classes for Block Storage were added to your cluster.

   ```text
    kubectl get storageclasses | grep ibmc-block
   ```

6. Set the Block Storage as the default storageclass.

   ```text
    kubectl patch storageclass ibmc-block-gold -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
    kubectl patch storageclass ibmc-file-gold -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"false"}}}'

    # Check the default storageclass is block storage
    kubectl get storageclass | grep \(default\)
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
    ibmc-block-gold (default)   ibm.io/ibmc-block   65s
   ```

   **3. Preparation**

Add the Feast Helm repository and download the latest charts:

```text
helm repo add feast-charts https://feast-helm-charts.storage.googleapis.com
helm repo update
```

Feast includes a Helm chart that installs all necessary components to run Feast Core, Feast Online Serving, and an example Jupyter notebook.

Feast Core requires Postgres to run, which requires a secret to be set on Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic feast-postgresql --from-literal=postgresql-password=password
```

## 4. Installation

Install Feast using Helm. The pods may take a few minutes to initialize.

```bash
helm install feast-release feast-charts/feast
```

## 5. Use Jupyter to connect to Feast

After all the pods are in a `RUNNING` state, port-forward to the Jupyter Notebook Server in the cluster:

```bash
kubectl port-forward \
$(kubectl get pod -l app=feast-jupyter -o custom-columns=:metadata.name) 8888:8888
```

```text
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8888 -> 8888
Forwarding from [::1]:8888 -> 8888
```

You can now connect to the bundled Jupyter Notebook Server at `localhost:8888` and follow the example Jupyter notebook.

## 6. Troubleshooting

When running the minimal\_ride\_hailing\_example Jupyter Notebook example the following errors may occur:

1. When running `job = client.get_historical_features(...)`:

   ```text
    KeyError: 'historical_feature_output_location'
   ```

   or

   ```text
    KeyError: 'spark_staging_location'
   ```

   Add the following environment variable:

   ```text
    os.environ["FEAST_HISTORICAL_FEATURE_OUTPUT_LOCATION"] = "file:///home/jovyan/historical_feature_output"
    os.environ["FEAST_SPARK_STAGING_LOCATION"] = "file:///home/jovyan/test_data"
   ```

2. When running `job.get_status()`

   ```text
    <SparkJobStatus.FAILED: 2>
   ```

   Add the following environment variable:

   ```text
    os.environ["FEAST_REDIS_HOST"] = "feast-release-redis-master"
   ```

3. When running `job = client.start_stream_to_online_ingestion(...)`

   ```text
    org.apache.kafka.vendor.common.KafkaException: Failed to construct kafka consumer
   ```

   Add the following environment variable:

   ```text
    os.environ["DEMO_KAFKA_BROKERS"] = "feast-release-kafka:9092"
   ```
