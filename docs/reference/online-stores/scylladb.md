# ScyllaDB Cloud online store

## Description

ScyllaDB is a low-latency and high-performance Cassandra-compatible (uses CQL) database. You can use the existing Cassandra connector to use ScyllaDB as an online store in Feast.

The [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/) online store provides support for materializing feature values into a ScyllaDB or [ScyllaDB Cloud](https://www.scylladb.com/product/scylla-cloud/) cluster for serving online features real-time.

## Getting started

Install Feast with Cassandra support:
```bash
pip install "feast[cassandra]"
```

Create a new Feast project:
```bash
feast init REPO_NAME -t cassandra
```

### Example (ScyllaDB)

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: scylla_feature_repo
registry: data/registry.db
provider: local
online_store:
    type: cassandra
    hosts:
        - 172.17.0.2
    keyspace: feast
    username: scylla
    password: password
```
{% endcode %}

### Example (ScyllaDB Cloud)

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: scylla_feature_repo
registry: data/registry.db
provider: local
online_store:
    type: cassandra
    hosts:
        - node-0.aws_us_east_1.xxxxxxxx.clusters.scylla.cloud
        - node-1.aws_us_east_1.xxxxxxxx.clusters.scylla.cloud
        - node-2.aws_us_east_1.xxxxxxxx.clusters.scylla.cloud
    keyspace: feast
    username: scylla
    password: password
```
{% endcode %}

## Functionality Matrix

The set of functionality supported by online stores is described in detail [here](overview.md#functionality).
Below is a matrix indicating which functionality is supported by the Cassandra plugin.
