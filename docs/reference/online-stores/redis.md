# Redis online store

## Description

The [Redis](https://redis.io) online store provides support for materializing feature values into Redis.

* Both Redis and Redis Cluster are supported.
* The data model used to store feature values in Redis is described in more detail [here](../../specs/online\_store\_format.md).

## Getting started
In order to use this online store, you'll need to install the redis extra (along with the dependency needed for the offline store of choice). E.g.
-  `pip install 'feast[gcp, redis]'`
-  `pip install 'feast[snowflake, redis]'`
-  `pip install 'feast[aws, redis]'`
-  `pip install 'feast[azure, redis]'`

You can get started by using any of the other templates (e.g. `feast init -t gcp` or `feast init -t snowflake` or `feast init -t aws`), and then swapping in Redis as the online store as seen below in the examples.

## Examples

Connecting to a single Redis instance:

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: my_feature_repo
registry: data/registry.db
provider: local
online_store:
  type: redis
  connection_string: "localhost:6379"
```
{% endcode %}

Connecting to a Redis Cluster with SSL enabled and password authentication:

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: my_feature_repo
registry: data/registry.db
provider: local
online_store:
  type: redis
  redis_type: redis_cluster
  connection_string: "redis1:6379,redis2:6379,ssl=true,password=my_password"
```
{% endcode %}

The full set of configuration options is available in [RedisOnlineStoreConfig](https://rtd.feast.dev/en/latest/#feast.infra.online_stores.redis.RedisOnlineStoreConfig).

## Functionality Matrix
