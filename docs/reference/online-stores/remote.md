# Remote online store

## Description

This remote online store will let you interact with remote feature server. At this moment this only supports the read operation. You can use this online store and able retrieve online features `store.get_online_features`  from remote feature server. 

## Examples

The registry is pointing to registry of remote feature store. If it is not accessible then should be configured to use remote registry.

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: my-local-project
registry: /remote/data/registry.db
provider: local
online_store:
  path: http://localhost:6566
  type: remote
  cert: /path/to/cert.pem
entity_key_serialization_version: 2
auth:
  type: no_auth
```
{% endcode %}

`cert` is an optional configuration to the public certificate path when the online server starts in TLS(SSL) mode. This may be needed if the online server is started with a self-signed certificate, typically this file ends with `*.crt`, `*.cer`, or `*.pem`.
