# ElasticSearch online store (contrib)

## Description

The ElasticSearch online store provides support for materializing tabular feature values, as well as embedding feature vectors, into an ElasticSearch index for serving online features. \
The embedding feature vectors are stored as dense vectors, and can be used for similarity search. More information on dense vectors can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/dense-vector.html).

## Getting started
In order to use this online store, you'll need to run `pip install 'feast[elasticsearch]'`. You can get started by then running `feast init -t elasticsearch`.

## Example

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: my_feature_repo
registry: data/registry.db
provider: local
online_store:
    type: elasticsearch
    host: ES_HOST
    port: ES_PORT
    user: ES_USERNAME
    password: ES_PASSWORD
    vector_len: 512
    write_batch_size: 1000
```
{% endcode %}

The full set of configuration options is available in [ElasticsearchOnlineStoreConfig](https://rtd.feast.dev/en/master/#feast.infra.online_stores.contrib.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchOnlineStoreConfig).

## Retrieving online document vectors

The ElasticSearch online store supports retrieving document vectors for a given list of entity keys. The document vectors are returned as a dictionary where the key is the entity key and the value is the document vector. The document vector is a dense vector of floats.

{% code title="python" %}
```python
from feast import FeatureStore

feature_store = FeatureStore(repo_path="feature_store.yaml")

query_vector = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
top_k = 5

# Retrieve the top k closest features to the query vector

feature_values = feature_store.retrieve_online_documents(
    feature="my_feature",
    query=query_vector,
    top_k=top_k
)
```
{% endcode %}

## Indexing
Currently, the indexing mapping in the ElasticSearch online store is configured as:

{% code title="indexing_mapping" %}
```json
"properties": {
    "entity_key": {"type": "binary"},
    "feature_name": {"type": "keyword"},
    "feature_value": {"type": "binary"},
    "timestamp": {"type": "date"},
    "created_ts": {"type": "date"},
    "vector_value": {
        "type": "dense_vector",
        "dims": config.online_store.vector_len,
        "index": "true",
        "similarity": config.online_store.similarity,
    },
}
```
{% endcode %}
And the online_read API mapping is configured as:

{% code title="online_read_mapping" %}
```json
"query": {
    "bool": {
        "must": [
            {"terms": {"entity_key": entity_keys}},
            {"terms": {"feature_name": requested_features}},
        ]
    }
},
```
{% endcode %}

And the similarity search API mapping is configured as:

{% code title="similarity_search_mapping" %}
```json
{
    "field": "vector_value",
    "query_vector": embedding_vector,
    "k": top_k,
}
```
{% endcode %}

These APIs are subject to change in future versions of Feast to improve performance and usability.
