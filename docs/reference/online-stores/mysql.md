# MySQL online store

## Description

The MySQL online store provides support for materializing feature values into a MySQL database for serving online features.

* Only the latest feature values are persisted

## Getting started
In order to use this online store, you'll need to run `pip install 'feast[mysql]'`. You can get started by then running `feast init` and then setting the `feature_store.yaml` as described below.

## Example

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: my_feature_repo
registry: data/registry.db
provider: local
online_store:
    type: mysql
    host: DB_HOST
    port: DB_PORT
    database: DB_NAME
    user: DB_USERNAME
    password: DB_PASSWORD
```
{% endcode %}

The full set of configuration options is available in [MySQLOnlineStoreConfig](https://rtd.feast.dev/en/master/#feast.infra.online_stores.mysql_online_store.MySQLOnlineStoreConfig).

## Batch write mode
By default, the MySQL online store performs row-by-row insert and commit for each feature record. While this ensures per-record atomicity, it can lead to significant overhead on write operations â€” especially on distributed SQL databases (for example, TiDB, which is MySQL-compatible and uses a consensus protocol).

To improve writing performance, you can enable batch write mode by setting `batch_write` to `true` and `batch_size`, which executes multiple insert queries in batches and commits them together per batch instead of committing each record individually.

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: my_feature_repo
registry: data/registry.db
provider: local
online_store:
    type: mysql
    host: DB_HOST
    port: DB_PORT
    database: DB_NAME
    user: DB_USERNAME
    password: DB_PASSWORD
    batch_write: true
    batch_size: 100
```
{% endcode %}
