# MySQL online store (contrib)

## Description

The MySQL online store provides support for materializing feature values into a MySQL database for serving online features.

* Only the latest feature values are persisted

## Getting started
In order to use this online store, you'll need to run `pip install 'feast[mysql]'`. You can get started by then running `feast init` and then setting the `feature_store.yaml` as described below.

## Example

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: my_feature_repo
registry: data/registry.db
provider: local
online_store:
    type: mysql
    host: DB_HOST
    port: DB_PORT
    database: DB_NAME
    user: DB_USERNAME
    password: DB_PASSWORD
```
{% endcode %}

The full set of configuration options is available in [MySQLOnlineStoreConfig](https://rtd.feast.dev/en/master/#feast.infra.online_stores.contrib.mysql.MySQLOnlineStoreConfig).
