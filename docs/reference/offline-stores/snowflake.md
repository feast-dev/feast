# Snowflake offline store

## Description

The [Snowflake](https://trial.snowflake.com) offline store provides support for reading [SnowflakeSources](../data-sources/snowflake.md).
* All joins happen within Snowflake.
* Entity dataframes can be provided as a SQL query or can be provided as a Pandas dataframe. A Pandas dataframes will be uploaded to Snowflake as a temporary table in order to complete join operations.

## Getting started
In order to use this offline store, you'll need to run `pip install 'feast[snowflake]'`. 

If you're using a file based registry, then you'll also need to install the relevant cloud extra (`pip install 'feast[snowflake, CLOUD]'` where `CLOUD` is one of `aws`, `gcp`, `azure`)

You can get started by then running `feast init -t snowflake`.

## Example

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: my_feature_repo
registry: data/registry.db
provider: local
offline_store:
  type: snowflake.offline
  account: snowflake_deployment.us-east-1
  user: user_login
  password: user_password
  role: sysadmin
  warehouse: demo_wh
  database: FEAST
```
{% endcode %}

The full set of configuration options is available in [SnowflakeOfflineStoreConfig](https://rtd.feast.dev/en/latest/#feast.infra.offline_stores.snowflake.SnowflakeOfflineStoreConfig).
