# Metrics Reference

Reference of the metrics that each Feast component exports:

* [Feast Core](./#feast-core)
* [Feast Serving](./#feast-serving)
* [Feast Ingestion Job](./#feast-ingestion-job)

For how to configure Feast to export Metrics, see the [Metrics user guide.](../../advanced/metrics.md)

## Feast Core

**Exported Metrics**

Feast Core exports the following metrics:

| Metrics | Description | Tags |

| `feast_core_feature_set_total` | No. of Feature Sets registered with Feast Core. | None |
| `feast_core_store_total` | No. of Stores registered with Feast Core. | None |
| `feast_core_max_memory_bytes` | Max amount of memory the Java virtual machine will attempt to use. | None |
| `feast_core_total_memory_bytes` | Total amount of memory in the Java virtual machine | None |
| `feast_core_free_memory_bytes` | Total amount of free memory in the Java virtual machine. | None |
| `feast_core_gc_collection_seconds` | Time spent in a given JVM garbage collector in seconds. | None |

**Metric Tags**

Exported Feast Core metrics may be filtered by the following tags/keys

| Tag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `service` | Name of the Service that request is made to. Should be set to `CoreService` |
| `method` | Name of the Method that the request is calling. \(ie `ListFeatureSets`\) |
| `status_code` | Status code returned as a result of handling the requests \(ie `OK`\). Can be used to find request failures. |

## Feast Serving

**Exported Metrics**

Feast Serving exports the following metrics:

| Metric | Description | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `feast_serving_request_latency_seconds` | Feast Serving's latency in serving Requests in  Seconds. | `method` |

| `feast_serving_grpc_request_count` | Total gRPC requests served. | `method` |

**Metric Tags**

Exported Feast Serving metrics may be filtered by the following tags/keys

| Tag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `method` | Name of the Method that the request is calling. \(ie `ListFeatureSets`\) |
| `status_code` | Status code returned as a result of handling the requests \(ie `OK`\). Can be used to find request failures. |
| `project` | Name of the project that the FeatureSet of the Feature retrieved belongs to. |
| `feature_name` | Name of the Feature being retrieved. |

## Feast Ingestion Job

Feast Ingestion computes both metrics an statistics on [data ingestion.](../../user-guide/data-ingestion.md) Make sure you familar with data ingestion concepts before proceeding.

{% hint style="info" %}
For documentation on Feature value statistics computed by the Ingestion Job see [Statistics]()
{% endhint %}

**Metrics Namespace**

Metrics are computed at  two stages of the Feature Row's/Feature Value's life cycle when being processed by the Ingestion Job:

* `Inflight`- Prior to writing data to stores, but after successful validation of data.
* `WriteToStoreSucess`-  After a successful store write.

Metrics processed by each staged will be tagged with `metrics_namespace`  to the stage where the metric was computed.

**Metrics Bucketing**

Metrics with a `{BUCKET}` are computed on a 60 second window/bucket. Suffix with the following to select the bucket to use:

* `min` - minimum value.
* `max` - maximum value.
* `mean`- mean value.
* `percentile_90`- 90 percentile.
* `percentile_95`- 95 percentile.
* `percentile_99`- 99 percentile.
