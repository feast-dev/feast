# Local Registry

## Description

Local registry provides support for storing the protobuf representation of your feature store objects (data sources, feature views, feature services, etc.) in local file system. It is only intended to be used for experimentation with Feast and should not be used in production.

There are inherent limitations with a file-based registries, since changing a single field in the registry requires re-writing the whole registry file. With multiple concurrent writers, this presents a risk of data loss, or bottlenecks writes to the registry since all changes have to be serialized (e.g. when running materialization for multiple feature views or time ranges concurrently).

An example of how to configure this would be:

## Example

{% code title="feature_store.yaml" %}
```yaml
project: feast_local
registry:
  path: registry.pb
  cache_ttl_seconds: 60
online_store: null
offline_store:
  type: dask
```
{% endcode %}
