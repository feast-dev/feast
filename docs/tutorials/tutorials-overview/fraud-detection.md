  A common use case in machine learning, this tutorial is an end-to-end,
  production-ready fraud prediction system. It predicts in real-time whether a
  transaction made by a user is fraudulent.

# Fraud detection on GCP

Throughout this tutorial, weâ€™ll walk through the creation of a production-ready fraud prediction system. A prediction is made in real-time as the user makes the transaction, so we need to be able to generate a prediction at low latency.

## [Fraud Detection Example](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast-fraud-tutorial)

Our end-to-end example will perform the following workflows:

* Computing and backfilling feature data from raw data
* Building point-in-time correct training datasets from feature data and training a model
* Making online predictions from feature data

Here's a high-level picture of our system architecture on Google Cloud Platform (GCP):
