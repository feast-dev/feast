    "In this notebook you will connect to your feature store and register features into a central repository hosted on Azure Blob Storage. It should be noted that best practice for registering features would be through a CI/CD process e.g. GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps.\n",

    "## What is Feast?\n",
    "\n",
    "Feast is an operational data system for managing and serving machine learning features to models in production. Feast is able to serve feature data to models from a low-latency online store (for real-time prediction) or from an offline store (for scale-out batch scoring or model training).\n",
