## 2. Development guide

### 2.1 Overview

The following guide will help you quickly run Feast in your local machine.

The main components of Feast are:

* **Feast Core:** Handles feature registration, starts and manages ingestion jobs and ensures that Feast internal metadata is consistent.
* **Feast Ingestion Jobs:** Subscribes to streams of FeatureRows and writes these as feature

  values to registered databases \(online, historical\) that can be read by Feast Serving.

* **Feast Serving:** Service that handles requests for features values, either online or batch.

### 2.**2 Requirements**

#### 2.**2.1 Development environment** 

The following software is required for Feast development

* Java SE Development Kit 11
* Python version 3.6 \(or above\) and pip
* [Maven ](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)version 3.6.x

Additionally, [grpc\_cli](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/command_line_tool.md) is useful for debugging and quick testing of gRPC endpoints.

#### 2.**2.2 Services**

The following components/services are required to develop Feast:

* **Feast Core:** Requires PostgreSQL \(version 11 and above\) to store state, and requires a Kafka \(tested on version 2.x\) setup to allow for ingestion of FeatureRows.
* **Feast Serving:** Requires Redis \(tested on version 5.x\).

These services should be running before starting development. The following snippet will start the services using Docker.

```bash
# Start Postgres
docker run --name postgres --rm -it -d --net host -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres:12-alpine

# Start Redis
docker run --name redis --rm -it --net host -d redis:5-alpine

# Start Zookeeper (needed by Kafka)
docker run --rm \
  --net=host \
  --name=zookeeper \
  --env=ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT=2181 \
  --detach confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:5.2.1

# Start Kafka
docker run --rm \
  --net=host \
  --name=kafka \
  --env=KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=localhost:2181 \
  --env=KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092 \
  --env=KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1 \
  --detach confluentinc/cp-kafka:5.2.1
```

### 2.3 Testing and development

#### 2.3.1 Running unit tests

```text
$ mvn test
```

#### 2.3.2 Running integration tests

_Note: integration suite isn't yet separated from unit._

```text
$ mvn verify
```

#### 2.3.3 Running components locally

The `core` and `serving` modules are Spring Boot applications. These may be run as usual for [the Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/maven-plugin/index.html):

```text
$ mvn --projects core spring-boot:run

# Or for short:
$ mvn -pl core spring-boot:run
```

Note that you should execute `mvn` from the Feast repository root directory, as there are intermodule dependencies that Maven will not resolve if you `cd` to subdirectories to run.

#### 2.3.4 Running from IntelliJ

Compiling and running tests in IntelliJ should work as usual.

Running the Spring Boot apps may work out of the box in IDEA Ultimate, which has built-in support for Spring Boot projects, but the Community Edition needs a bit of help:

The Spring Boot Maven plugin automatically puts dependencies with `provided` scope on the runtime classpath when using `spring-boot:run`, such as its embedded Tomcat server. The "Play" buttons in the gutter or right-click menu of a `main()` method [do not do this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30237768/run-spring-boots-main-using-ide).

A solution to this is:

1. Open `View > Tool Windows > Maven`
2. Drill down to e.g. `Feast Core > Plugins > spring-boot:run`, right-click and `Create 'feast-core [spring-boot'â€¦`
3. In the dialog that pops up, check the `Resolve Workspace artifacts` box
4. Recommended: add `-Dspring-boot.run.fork=false` to the `Command line` field to get Debug working too
5. Click `OK`. You should now be able to select this run configuration for the Play button in the main toolbar, keyboard shortcuts, etc.

It is recommend to have IntelliJ delegate building to Maven, if this is not enabled out of the box when you import the project, for greater assurance that build behavior is consistent with CI / production builds. This is set in Preferences at `Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven > Runner > Delegate IDE build/run actions to Maven`.

### 2.**4** Validating your setup

The following section is a quick walk-through to test whether your local Feast deployment is functional for development purposes.

**2.4.1 Assumptions**

* PostgreSQL is running in `localhost:5432` and has a database called `postgres` which

  can be accessed with credentials user `postgres` and password `password`. Different database configurations can be supplied here \(`/core/src/main/resources/application.yml`\)

* Redis is running locally and accessible from `localhost:6379`   
* \(optional\) The local environment has been authentication with Google Cloud Platform and has full access to BigQuery. This is only necessary for BigQuery testing/development.

#### 2.4.2 Clone Feast

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gojek/feast.git && cd feast && \
export FEAST_HOME_DIR=$(pwd)
```

#### 2.4.3 Starting Feast Core

To run Feast Core locally using Maven:

```bash
# Feast Core can be configured from the following .yml file
# $FEAST_HOME_DIR/core/src/main/resources/application.yml
mvn --projects core spring-boot:run
```

Test whether Feast Core is running

```text
grpc_cli call localhost:6565 ListStores ''
```

The output should list **no** stores since no Feast Serving has registered its stores to Feast Core:

```text
connecting to localhost:6565

Rpc succeeded with OK status
```

#### 2.4.4 Starting Feast Serving

Feast Serving is configured through the `$FEAST_HOME_DIR/serving/src/main/resources/application.yml`. Each Serving deployment must be configured with a store. The default store is Redis \(used for online serving\).

The configuration for this default store is located in a separate `.yml` file. The default location is `$FEAST_HOME_DIR/serving/sample_redis_config.yml`:   

```text
name: serving
type: REDIS
redis_config:
  host: localhost
  port: 6379
subscriptions:
  - name: "*"
    project: "*"
    version: "*"
```

Once Feast Serving is started, it will register its store with Feast Core \(by name\) and start to subscribe to a feature sets based on its subscription. 

Start Feast Serving GRPC server on localhost:6566 with store name `serving`

```text
mvn --projects serving spring-boot:run
```

Test connectivity to Feast Serving

```text
grpc_cli call localhost:6566 GetFeastServingInfo ''
```

```text
connecting to localhost:6566
version: "0.4.2-SNAPSHOT"
type: FEAST_SERVING_TYPE_ONLINE

Rpc succeeded with OK status
```

Test Feast Core to see whether it is aware of the Feast Serving deployment

```text
grpc_cli call localhost:6565 ListStores ''
```

```text
connecting to localhost:6565
store {
  name: "serving"
  type: REDIS
  subscriptions {
    name: "*"
    version: "*"
    project: "*"
  }
  redis_config {
    host: "localhost"
    port: 6379
  }
}

Rpc succeeded with OK status
```

In order to use BigQuery as a historical store, it is necessary to start Feast Serving with a different store type. 

Copy `$FEAST_HOME_DIR/serving/sample_redis_config.yml`  to the following location `$FEAST_HOME_DIR/serving/my_bigquery_config.yml` and update the configuration as below:

```text
name: bigquery
type: BIGQUERY
bigquery_config:
  project_id: YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID
  dataset_id: YOUR_GCP_DATASET
subscriptions:
  - name: "*"
    version: "*"
    project: "*"
```

Then inside `serving/src/main/resources/application.yml` modify the following key `feast.store.config-path`  to point to the new store configuration.

After making these changes, restart Feast Serving:

```text
mvn --projects serving spring-boot:run
```

You should see two stores registered:

```text
store {
  name: "serving"
  type: REDIS
  subscriptions {
    name: "*"
    version: "*"
    project: "*"
  }
  redis_config {
    host: "localhost"
    port: 6379
  }
}
store {
  name: "bigquery"
  type: BIGQUERY
  subscriptions {
    name: "*"
    version: "*"
    project: "*"
  }
  bigquery_config {
    project_id: "my_project"
    dataset_id: "my_bq_dataset"
  }
}
```

#### 2.4.5 Registering a FeatureSet

Before registering a new FeatureSet, a project is required.

```text
grpc_cli call localhost:6565 CreateProject '
  name: "your_project_name"
'
```

When a feature set is successfully registered, Feast Core will start an **ingestion** job that listens for new features in the feature set.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that Feast currently only supports source of type `KAFKA`, so you must have access to a running Kafka broker to register a FeatureSet successfully. It is possible to omit the `source` from a Feature Set, but Feast Core will still use Kafka behind the scenes, it is simply abstracted away from the user. 
{% endhint %}

Create a new FeatureSet in Feast by sending a request to Feast Core:

```text
# Example of registering a new driver feature set
# Note the source value, it assumes that you have access to a Kafka broker
# running on localhost:9092

grpc_cli call localhost:6565 ApplyFeatureSet '
feature_set {
  spec {
    project: "your_project_name"
    name: "driver"
    version: 1

    entities {
      name: "driver_id"
      value_type: INT64
    }

    features {
      name: "city"
      value_type: STRING
    }

    source {
      type: KAFKA
      kafka_source_config {
        bootstrap_servers: "localhost:9092"
        topic: "your-kafka-topic"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

Verify that the FeatureSet has been registered correctly.

```text
# To check that the FeatureSet has been registered correctly.
# You should also see logs from Feast Core of the ingestion job being started
grpc_cli call localhost:6565 GetFeatureSet '
  project: "your_project_name"
  name: "driver"
'
```

Or alternatively, list all feature sets

```text
grpc_cli call localhost:6565 ListFeatureSets '
  filter {
    project: "your_project_name"
    feature_set_name: "driver"
    feature_set_version: "1"
  }
'
```

#### 2.4.6 Ingestion and Population of Feature Values

```text
# Produce FeatureRow messages to Kafka so it will be ingested by Feast
# and written to the registered stores.
# Make sure the value here is the topic assigned to the feature set
# ... producer.send("feast-driver-features" ...)
#
# Install Python SDK to help writing FeatureRow messages to Kafka
cd $FEAST_HOMEDIR/sdk/python
pip3 install -e .
pip3 install pendulum

# Produce FeatureRow messages to Kafka so it will be ingested by Feast
# and written to the corresponding store.
# Make sure the value here is the topic assigned to the feature set
# ... producer.send("feast-test_feature_set-features" ...)
python3 - <<EOF
import logging
import pendulum
from google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2 import Timestamp
from kafka import KafkaProducer
from feast.types.FeatureRow_pb2 import FeatureRow
from feast.types.Field_pb2 import Field
from feast.types.Value_pb2 import Value, Int32List, BytesList

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers="localhost:9092")

row = FeatureRow()

fields = [
    Field(name="driver_id", value=Value(int64_val=1234)),
    Field(name="city", value=Value(string_val="JAKARTA")),
]
row.fields.MergeFrom(fields)

timestamp = Timestamp()
timestamp.FromJsonString(
    pendulum.now("UTC").to_iso8601_string()
)
row.event_timestamp.CopyFrom(timestamp)

# The format is [PROJECT_NAME]/[FEATURE_NAME]:[VERSION]
row.feature_set = "your_project_name/driver:1"

producer.send("your-kafka-topic", row.SerializeToString())
producer.flush()
logger.info(row)
EOF
```

#### 2.4.7 Retrieval from Feast Serving

Ensure that Feast Serving returns results for the feature value for the specific driver

```text
grpc_cli call localhost:6566 GetOnlineFeatures '
features {
  project: "your_project_name"
  name: "city"
  version: 1
  max_age {
    seconds: 3600
  }
}
entity_rows {
  fields {
    key: "driver_id"
    value {
      int64_val: 1234
    }
  }
}
'
```

```text
field_values {
  fields {
    key: "driver_id"
    value {
      int64_val: 1234
    }
  }
  fields {
    key: "your_project_name/city:1"
    value {
      string_val: "JAKARTA"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2.4.8 Summary

If you have made it to this point successfully you should have a functioning Feast deployment, at the very least using the Apache Beam DirectRunner for ingestion jobs and Redis for online serving. 

It is important to note that most of the functionality demonstrated above is already available in a more abstracted form in the Python SDK \(Feast management, data ingestion, feature retrieval\) and the Java/Go SDKs \(feature retrieval\). However, it is useful to understand these internals from a development standpoint.

## 3. Style guide

Coding standards are checked automatically by continuous integration. Checking them during development will streamline your contributing experience.

For set-and-forget, you may install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and run `pre-commit install` in the root of the Feast project. This installs a Git hook that automatically formats code before you commit. You will need to have some development tools for all project languages installed, though.

If you have GNU Make, convenience targets are available such as `make lint-python`, `make format-java`, and comprehensive `make lint` and `format`, so that you don't need to remember all the incantations for language-specific tools.

Auto-formatting is a boon to code review and patch management over time, but it isn't perfect. Spot check your changes after formatting, and if something "looks bad", consider whether a small change like introducing a variable could improve readability for real people.

### 3.1 Java

We conform to the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Maven can helpfully take care of that for you:

```text
$ make format-java
```

Or if you don't have Make installed:

```text
$ mvn spotless:apply
```

Formatting is checked automatically just prior to the `test` phase of the build lifecycle, in effort to help us remember it before committing without hampering development flow too greatly. This can be skipped temporarily:

```text
$ mvn spotless:check  # Check is automatic upon `mvn test`
$ mvn test -Dspotless.check.skip
```

If you're using IntelliJ, you can install the [google-java-format plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format) if you'd like to use the IDE's reformat function as you develop. _Note that this uses a built-in version of the formatter that may drift from the Maven plugin over timeâ€”_`make lint-java` _is authoritative for CI, so it's still a good idea to check before submitting pull requests._

### 3.2 Go

`gofmt` style is followed for formatting. `go vet` and `golint` static analysis are also checked by:

```text
$ make lint-go
```

Apply formatting with:

```text
$ make format-go
```

`gofmt` is so ubiquitous in the Go ecosystem, it's almost certain that a plugin exists for your editor of choice to format files as you work.

### 3.3 Python

We use [Python Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to format our Python code prior to submission. To check it along with static analysis:

```text
$ make lint-python
```

And to format:

```text
$ make format-python
```
