# Release process

## Release process

For Feast maintainers, these are the concrete steps for making a new release.

### Pre-release Verification (Verification that wheels are built correctly) for minor release.
1. Merge upstream master changes into your **fork**. Make sure you are running the workflow off of your fork!
2. Create a tag manually for the release on your fork. For example, if you are doing a release for version 0.22.0, create a tag by doing the following.
   - Checkout master branch and run `git tag v0.22.0`.
   - Run `git push --tags` to push the tag to your forks master branch.
3. Access the `Actions` tab on your github UI on your fork and click the `build_wheels` action. This workflow will build the python sdk wheels for Python 3.8-3.10 on MacOS 10.15 and Linux and verify that these wheels are correct. The publish workflow uses this action to publish the python wheels for a new release to pypi.
4. Look for the header `This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger` and click `Run Workflow` on the right.
5. Run the workflow off of the tag you just created(`v0.22.0` in this case) and verify that the workflow worked (i.e ensure that all jobs are green).

### Pre-release Verification (Verification that wheels are built correctly) for patch release.
1. Check out the branch of your release (e.g `v0.22-branch` on your local **fork**) and push this to your fork (`git push -u origin <branch>`).
2. Cherry pick commits that are relevant to the patch release onto your forked branch.
3. Checkout the release branch and add a patch release tag (e.g `v0.22.1`) by running `git tag <tag>`.
4. Push tags to your origin branch with `git push origin <tag>`.
5. Kick off `build_wheels` workflow in the same way as is detailed in the last section on of the patch release tag.

### Release for Python and Java SDK
1. Generate a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) or retrieve your saved personal access token.
   * The personal access token should have all of the permissions under the `repo` checkbox.
2. Access the `Actions` tab on the main `feast-dev/feast` repo and find the `release` action.
3. Look for the header `This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger` again and click `Run Workflow` on the right.
   * If you are making a minor or major release, you should run it off of the master branch.
   * If you are making a patch release, run it off of the corresponding minor release branch.
4. Try the dry run first with your personal access token. If this succeeds, uncheck `Dry Run` and run the release workflow.
5. All of the jobs should succeed besides the UI job which needs to be released separately. Ping a maintainer on Slack to run the UI release manually.
6. Try to install the feast release in your local environment and test out the `feast init` -> `feast apply` workflow to verify as a sanity check that the release worked correctly.

### (for minor releases) Post-release steps
1. Create a new branch based on master (i.e. v0.22-branch) and push to the main Feast repo. This will be where cherry-picks go for future patch releases and where documentation will point.
2. Write a summary of the release in the GitHub release
   1. By default, Semantic Release will pull in messages from commits (features vs fixes, etc). But this is hard to digest still, so it helps to have a high level overview.

### Update documentation

In the Feast Gitbook (ask [Danny Chiao](https://tectonfeast.slack.com/team/U029405HFEU) in Slack for access):
1. Create a new space within the Feast collection
2. Go to the overflow menu on the top -> Synchronize with Git
   1. Specify GitHub as the provider

   2. Configure to point to the new release branch

3. Publish the new page for this branch as part of the collection

4. Go back to the main Feast collection and go to the overflow menu -> "Customize collection"

5. Configure the default space to be your new branch and save

6. Verify on docs.feast.dev that this new space is the default (this may take a few minutes to propagate, and your browser cache may be caching the old branch as the default)
