# Feast on Kubernetes

{% hint style="success" %}
Since Feast 0.10, it is not necessary to deploy Feast into Kubernetes any more. Feast runs as a light weight CLI/SDK that can configure your managed services to operate as a feature store. The documentation contained within this section exists for posterity sake and relates to Feast 0.9, which depends on both Kubernetes and Spark. Teams that want to consume from streaming sources have to continue to use this release until streaming support has been reintroduced to Feast.
