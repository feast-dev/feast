## Getting Started with Docker Compose

Clone the latest stable version of the [Feast repository](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/) and navigate to the `infra/docker-compose` sub-directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/feast-dev/feast.git
cd feast/infra/docker-compose
cp .env.sample .env
```

The `.env` file can optionally be configured based on your environment.

Bring up Feast:
```
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```
Please wait for the containers to start up. This could take a few minutes since the quickstart contains demo infastructure like Kafka and Jupyter.

Once the containers are all running, please connect to the provided [Jupyter Notebook](http://localhost:8888/tree/minimal) containing example notebooks to try out.
