Convert between positional (line and column-based) and offsets (range-based)
locations in a [virtual file][vfile].

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install vfile-location
```

## Use

```js
var vfile = require('vfile')
var vfileLocation = require('vfile-location')

var location = vfileLocation(vfile('foo\nbar\nbaz'))

var offset = location.toOffset({line: 3, column: 3}) // => 10
location.toPoint(offset) // => {line: 3, column: 3, offset: 10}
```

## API

### `location = vfileLocation(doc)`

Get transform functions for the given `doc` (`string`) or [`file`][vfile].

Returns an object with [`toOffset`][to-offset] and [`toPoint`][to-point].

### `location.toOffset(point)`

Get the `offset` (`number`) for a line and column-based [`point`][point] in the
bound file.
Returns `-1` when given invalid or out of bounds input.

### `location.toPoint(offset)`

Get the line and column-based [`point`][point] for `offset` in the bound file.
