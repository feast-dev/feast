   * Invoked when a node (matching test, if given) is found.
   * Visitors are free to transform node.
   * They can also transform the parent of node.
   * Replacing node itself, if visit.SKIP is not returned, still causes its descendants to be visited.
   * If adding or removing previous siblings (or next siblings, in case of reverse) of node,
   * visitor should return a new index (number) to specify the sibling to traverse after node is traversed.
   * Adding or removing next siblings of node (or previous siblings, in case of reverse)
   * is handled as expected without needing to return a new index.
   * Removing the children property of the parent still result in them being traversed.
   *
   * @param node Found node
   * @param index Position of found node within Parent
   * @param parent Parent of found node
   * @paramType V node type found
   * @returns
   * When Action is passed, treated as a tuple of [Action]
   * When Index is passed, treated as a tuple of [CONTINUE, Index]
   * When ActionTuple is passed,
   *   Note that passing a tuple only makes sense if the action is SKIP.
   *   If the action is EXIT, that action can be returned.
   *   If the action is CONTINUE, index can be returned.
