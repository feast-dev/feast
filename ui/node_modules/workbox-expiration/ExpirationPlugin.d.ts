/**
 * This plugin can be used in a `workbox-strategy` to regularly enforce a
 * limit on the age and / or the number of cached requests.
 *
 * It can only be used with `workbox-strategy` instances that have a
 * [custom `cacheName` property set](/web/tools/workbox/guides/configure-workbox#custom_cache_names_in_strategies).
 * In other words, it can't be used to expire entries in strategy that uses the
 * default runtime cache name.
 *
 * Whenever a cached response is used or updated, this plugin will look
 * at the associated cache and remove any old or extra responses.
 *
 * When using `maxAgeSeconds`, responses may be used *once* after expiring
 * because the expiration clean up will not have occurred until *after* the
 * cached response has been used. If the response has a "Date" header, then
 * a light weight expiration check is performed and the response will not be
 * used immediately.
 *
 * When using `maxEntries`, the entry least-recently requested will be removed
 * from the cache first.
