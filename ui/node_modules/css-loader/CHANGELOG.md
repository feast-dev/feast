### Bug Fixes

* reduce runtime ([#1378](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/1378)) ([cf3a3a7](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/cf3a3a7346aa73637ee6aae6fef5648965c31a47))

## [6.2.0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/compare/v6.1.0...v6.2.0) (2021-07-19)


### Features

* allow the `exportLocalsConvention` option can be a function, useful for named export ([#1351](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/1351)) ([3c4b357](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/3c4b35718273baaf9e0480db715b596fbe5d7453))

## [6.1.0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/compare/v6.0.0...v6.1.0) (2021-07-17)


### Features

* add `link` in schema ([#1345](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/1345)) ([7d4e493](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/7d4e4931390f9e9356af45ae03057d1505d73109))


### Bug Fixes

* respect the `localIdentRegExp` option ([#1349](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/1349)) ([42f150b](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/42f150b429afad9b0851d2e6bd75cec120885aa4))

## [6.0.0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/compare/v5.2.7...v6.0.0) (2021-07-14)

### Notes

* using `~` is deprecated when the `esModules` option is enabled (enabled by default) and can be removed from your code (**we recommend it**) (`url(~package/image.png)` -> `url(package/image.png)`, `@import url(~package/style.css)` -> `@import url(package/style.css)`, `composes: import from '~package/one.css';` -> `composes: import from 'package/one.css';`), but we still support it for historical reasons. Why can you remove it? The loader will first try to resolve `@import`/`url()`/etc as relative, if it cannot be resolved, the loader will try to resolve `@import`/`url()`/etc inside [`node_modules` or modules directories](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvemodules).
* `file-loader` and `url-loader` are deprecated, please migrate on [`asset modules`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/), since v6 `css-loader` is generating `new URL(...)` syntax, it enables by default built-in [`assets modules`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/), i.e. `type: 'asset'` for all `url()`

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* minimum supported `Node.js` version is `12.13.0`
* minimum supported `webpack` version is `5`, we recommend to update to the latest version for better performance
* for `url` and `import` options `Function` type was removed in favor `Object` type with the `filter` property, i.e. before `{ url: () => true }`, now `{ url: { filter: () => true } }` and  before `{ import: () => true }`, now `{ import: { filter: () => true } }`
* the `modules.compileType` option was removed in favor the `modules.mode` option with `icss` value, also the `modules` option can have `icss` string value
* `new URL()` syntax used for `url()`, only when the `esModules` option is enabled (enabled by default), it means you can bundle CSS for libraries
* [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) are handling in `url()`, it means you can register loaders for them, [example](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#rulescheme)
* aliases with `false` value for `url()` now generate empty data URI (i.e. `data:0,`), only when the `esModules` option is enabled (enabled by default)
* `[ext]` placeholder don't need `.` (dot) before for the `localIdentName` option, i.e. please change `.[ext]` on `[ext]` (no dot before) 
* `[folder]` placeholder was removed without replacement for the `localIdentName` option, please use a custom function if you need complex logic
* `[emoji]` placeholder was removed without replacement for the `localIdentName` option, please use a custom function if you need complex logic
* the `localIdentHashPrefix` was removed in favor the `localIdentHashSalt` option

### Features

* supported [`resolve.byDependency.css`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvebydependency) resolve options for `@import`
* supported [`resolve.byDependency.icss`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvebydependency) resolve CSS modules and ICSS imports (i.e. `composes`/etc)
* added `modules.localIdentHashFunction`, `modules.localIdentHashDigest`, `modules.localIdentHashDigestLength` options for better class hashing controlling
* less dependencies

### Bug Fixes

* better performance
* fixed circular `@import`

### Notes

* **we strongly recommend not to add `.css` to `resolve.extensions`, it reduces performance and in most cases it is simply not necessary, alternative you can set resolve options [by dependency](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvebydependency)**
