### Note:

As of 2.0.0 this package exports an es6 module in the main entry
(`/lib/AutoSizeInput.js`). If you are in an older environment, you'll need to
refer to the `.default` export:

```js
var AutoSizeInput = require('react-input-autosize').default;
```

Aside from this, the new version doesn't change any public API.
