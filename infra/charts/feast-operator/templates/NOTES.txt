2. Check that the operator is running:
   kubectl get deployment -n {{ include "feast-operator.namespace" . }} {{ include "feast-operator.fullname" . }}-controller-manager

3. View the operator logs:
   kubectl logs -n {{ include "feast-operator.namespace" . }} deployment/{{ include "feast-operator.fullname" . }}-controller-manager

4. To create a FeatureStore, create a custom resource:
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: feast.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: FeatureStore
   metadata:
     name: sample-feast
     namespace: {{ include "feast-operator.namespace" . }}
   spec:
     feastProject: feast-test
   EOF

5. Check the FeatureStore status:
   kubectl get featurestores -n {{ include "feast-operator.namespace" . }}

{{- if .Values.metrics.enabled }}
6. Metrics are available at:
   kubectl get service -n {{ include "feast-operator.namespace" . }} {{ include "feast-operator.fullnameWithSuffix" (dict "root" . "suffix" "metrics") }}
{{- end }}
