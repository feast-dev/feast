# Feast deployment installs the following components:
# - Feast Core
# - Feast Serving Online
# - Feast Serving Batch
# 
# The configuration for different components can be referenced from:
# - charts/feast-core/values.yaml
# - charts/feast-serving/values.yaml
#
# Note that "feast-serving-online" and "feast-serving-batch" are
# aliases to "feast-serving" chart since in typical scenario two instances
# of Feast Serving: online and batch will be deployed. Both described 
# using the same chart "feast-serving".
#
# The following are default values for typical Feast deployment, but not
# for production setting. Refer to "values-production.yaml" for recommended
# values in production environment.
# 
# Note that the import job by default uses DirectRunner 
# https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/direct/
# in this configuration since it allows Feast to run in more environments
# (unlike DataflowRunner which requires Google Cloud services).
# 
# A secret containing Google Cloud service account JSON key is required 
# in this configuration. 
# https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts
# 
# The Google Cloud service account must have the following roles:
# - bigquery.dataEditor
# - bigquery.jobUser
#
# Assuming a service account JSON key file has been downloaded to
# (please name the file key.json):
# /home/user/key.json
# 
# Run the following command to create the secret in your Kubernetes cluster:
#
# kubectl create secret generic feast-gcp-service-account \
#   --from-file=/home/user/key.json
