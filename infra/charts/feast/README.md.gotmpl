# Feast Helm Charts

> :warning: **Disclaimer**: Since Feast 0.10 our vision is to manage all infrastructure for feature store from one place - Feast SDK. But while this new paradigm is still in development, we are planning to support the installation of some Feast components (like Java feature server) through Helm chart presented in this repository. However, we do not expect helm chart to become a long-term solution for deploying Feast components to production, and some frictions still might exist. For example, you will need to manually sync some configurations from [feature_store.yaml](https://docs.feast.dev/reference/feature-repository/feature-store-yaml) into the chart context (like path to the registry file or project name).

This repo contains Helm charts for Feast components that are being installed on Kubernetes:
* Feast (root chart): The complete Helm chart containing all Feast components and dependencies. Most users will use this chart, but can selectively enable/disable subcharts using the values.yaml file.
    * [Feature Server](charts/feature-server): High performant JVM-based implementation of feature server. 
    * [Transformation Service](charts/transformation-service): Transformation server for calculating on-demand features
    * Redis: (Optional) One of possible options for an online store used by Feature Server
    
## Chart: Feast

{{ template "chart.description" . }} Current chart version is `{{ template "chart.version" . }}`

## Installation

Charts are published to `https://feast-helm-charts.storage.googleapis.com`. Please note that this URL is different from the URL we previously used (`feast-charts`)

Run the following commands to add the repository

```
helm repo add feast-charts https://feast-helm-charts.storage.googleapis.com
helm repo update
```

Install Feast
```
helm install feast-release feast-charts/feast
```

## Customize your installation

This Feast chart comes with a [values.yaml](values.yaml) that allows for configuration and customization of all sub-charts.

In order to modify the default configuration of Feature Server, please use the `application-override.yaml` key in the `values.yaml` file in this chart. A code snippet example
```
feature-server:
    application-override.yaml:
        enabled: true
        feast:
            active_store: online
            stores:
            - name: online
              type: REDIS
              config:
                host: localhost
                port: 6379

```

For the default configuration, please see the [Feature Server Configuration](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast-java/blob/master/serving/src/main/resources/application.yml).
