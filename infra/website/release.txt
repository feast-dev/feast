I tried some Prettier options (https://prettier.io/docs/options), but the
defaults seem perfectly fine for this project (see also Prettier's option
philosophy in https://prettier.io/docs/option-philosophy):

- most changes are in unifying quotes to double quotes, which we mostly use
  in src/, but have single quotes in the files in config/ that were auto
  generated when ejecting create-react-app

- we mostly had es5 style trailing commas (https://prettier.io/docs/options#trailing-commas)
  in src/, but inserting trailing commas wherever possible minimizes
  changed lines when adding items to multi-line lists

All formatting changes in code or config files were the result of running
`yarn format`.
