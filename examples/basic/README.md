# Feast Basic Customer Transactions Example

This is a minimal example of using Feast. In this example we will
1. Create a synthetic customer feature dataset
2. Register a feature set to represent these features in Feast
3. Ingest these features into Feast
4. Create a feature query to retrieve historical feature data
5. Create a feature query to retrieve online feature data

Please ensure that Feast is already installed and running before starting this example.
