        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we use feature stores to generate training data and power online model inference for a ride-sharing driver satisfaction prediction model. Feast addresses several common issues in this flow:\n",
        "1. **Training-serving skew and complex data joins:** Feature values often exist across multiple tables. Joining these datasets can be complicated, slow, and error-prone.\n",
        "  - Feast joins these tables with battle-tested logic that ensures *point-in-time* correctness so future feature values do not leak to models.\n",
        "  - Feast alerts users to offline / online skew with data quality monitoring. \n",
        "2. **Online feature availability:** At inference time, models often need access to features that aren't readily available and need to be precomputed from other datasources. \n",
        "  - Feast manages deployment to a variety of online stores (e.g. DynamoDB, Redis, Google Cloud Datastore) and ensures necessary features are consistently *available* and *freshly computed* at inference time.\n",
        "3. **Feature reusability and model versioning:** Different teams within an organization are often unable to reuse features across projects, resulting in duplicate feature creation logic. Models have data dependencies that need to be versioned, for example when running A/B tests on model versions.\n",
        "  - Feast enables discovery of and collaboration on previously used features and enables versioning of sets of features (via *feature services*). \n",
        "  - Feast enables feature transformation so users can re-use transformation logic across online / offline usecases and across models.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will:\n",
        "- Deploy a local feature store with a Parquet file offline store and Sqlite online store.\n",
        "- Build a training dataset using our time series features from our Parquet files.\n",
        "- Materialize feature values from the offline store into the online store in preparation for low latency serving.\n",
        "- Read the latest features from the online store for inference."
