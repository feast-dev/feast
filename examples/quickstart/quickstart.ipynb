        "\n",
        "1. **Training-serving skew and complex data joins:** Feature values often exist across multiple tables. Joining \n",
        "   these datasets can be complicated, slow, and error-prone.\n",
        "   * Feast joins these tables with battle-tested logic that ensures _point-in-time_ correctness so future feature \n",
        "     values do not leak to models.\n",
        "2. **Online feature availability:** At inference time, models often need access to features that aren't readily \n",
        "   available and need to be precomputed from other data sources.\n",
        "   * Feast manages deployment to a variety of online stores (e.g. DynamoDB, Redis, Google Cloud Datastore) and \n",
        "     ensures necessary features are consistently _available_ and _freshly computed_ at inference time.\n",
        "3. **Feature and model versioning:** Different teams within an organization are often unable to reuse \n",
        "   features across projects, resulting in duplicate feature creation logic. Models have data dependencies that need \n",
        "   to be versioned, for example when running A/B tests on model versions.\n",
        "   * Feast enables discovery of and collaboration on previously used features and enables versioning of sets of \n",
        "     features (via _feature services_).\n",
        "   * _(Experimental)_ Feast enables light-weight feature transformations so users can re-use transformation logic \n",

        "3. Materialize feature values from the offline store into the online store.\n",
        "4. Read the latest features from the online store for inference."
