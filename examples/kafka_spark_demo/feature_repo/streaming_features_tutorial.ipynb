    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores how data scientists and engineers can build streaming features in Feast. It builds off of the first [module](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast-workshop/tree/main/module_1) from the Feast workshop. The workshop module is not a prerequisite, but is recommended if you are not already familiar with the Push API in Feast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming features are a powerful tool to increase model performance and decrease training-serving skew. If streaming features are built correctly, models in production can use extremely fresh features, which often leads to dramatic improvements. However, there are many challenges around building streaming features. For example, how does a data scientist define streaming features? How does the data scientist connect the stream data source with the appropriate batch data source? What if there are transformations involved? Who is responsible for keeping the streaming features alive in production? How do they ensure that the streaming features in production are consistent with the features available for training in an offline setting? Feast can help solve these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical pattern that we see is that data scientists use Feast to define, use, and share features, which greatly improves their productivity, while ML engineers use Feast to ensure that all the features are available for both training and serving. This notebook will first show how a data scientist can define and use stream features in Feast (sections 3 and 4), and then how an ML engineer can use the Push API to ensure that those streaming features are available in production (section 5).\n",
