WriteFeatureValueMetricsDoFnTest.input file contains data that can be read by test utility 
into map of FeatureSetRef -> [FeatureRow]. In the first row, the cell value corresponds to the
field name in the FeatureRow. This should not be changed as the test utility derives the value
type from this name. Empty value in the cell is a value that is not set. For list type, the values
of different element is separated by the '|' character.

WriteFeatureValueMetricsDoFnTest.output file contains lines of expected StatsD metrics that should
be sent when WriteFeatureValueMetricsDoFn runs. It can be checked against the actual outputted
StatsD metrics to test for correctness.
