[Full Changelog](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/compare/v0.1.8...v0.3.0)

**Summary:**

* Introduced "Feature Sets" as a concept with a new [Feast Core API](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/blob/v0.3.0/protos/feast/core/CoreService.proto), [Feast Serving API](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/blob/v0.3.0/protos/feast/serving/ServingService.proto)
* Upgraded [Python SDK](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/tree/v0.3.0/sdk/python) to support new Feast API. Allows for management of Feast as a library or through the command line.
* Implemented a [Golang SDK](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/tree/v0.3.0/sdk/go) and [Java SDK](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/tree/v0.3.0/sdk/java) to support the new Feast Core and Feast Serving APIs.
* Added support for multi-feature set retrieval and joins.
* Added point-in-time correct retrieval for both batch and online serving.
* Added support for an external source in Kafka.
* Added job management to Feast Core to manage ingestion/population jobs to remote Feast deployments
* Added metric support through Prometheus
